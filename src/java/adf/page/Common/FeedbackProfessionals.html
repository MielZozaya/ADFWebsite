            <h1>What Professionals say about the 5-Step Intervention</h1>
<p><em>&rdquo;Over the five sessions I have seen family members move from &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to talk about&rsquo; to a recognition of own needs for an outlet for stress and validity of feelings in relation to a stressful situation&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;The structure of the sessions helped us to focus on positive change whilst acknowledging feelings.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;It gave me confidence to know that actually the stuff I had done was actually okay, and I had fears of working with family members,I have crossed that bridge and will not go back&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;Personnally I find the sessions a positive professional experience; I have learnt so much from the family member's presence&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;Working in this way quite pleasing and rewarding, when it is working well, and people seem to be getting the best out of it&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;It opens the door for more people to deal with the feelings and minimize the effects of the drinking. It makes the sessions more interesting counselling when you are dealing with someone with a drinking problem. I think it is absolutely great&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;Working with family members allows you capture dynamic interactions that would have been impossible to capture if not in the environment of doing family work and gives more light to the individual circumstance and dynamics of relations or support she may have&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;It is self-evident to me that it </em>(working with family members) <em>is more effective, you can get as far as and as wide a view with many people than you would get with just one.Besides you would also be addressing the need of more than just one person&rdquo;.</em></p>
