            <h1>Feedback from family/network members</h1>
            <p><em>&rdquo;The programme is quite easy to use, intuitive and the instructions pretty straight forward&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p>&ldquo;It makes you feel supported that somebody knows what you are going through&rdquo;</p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;The programme helps challenge me to think about the specifics of what I think or feel about the issues.Providing answers to questions asked in the programme caused me to pause and think how I might feel or put into words. It is kind of difficult to put into words but it was generally positive&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;It was a therapeutic experience online for me&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;Being able to put down what you were thinking in the exercise after getting on. That wasnin addition to the questions that were asked and allowed you to think through your answers&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;And this would make available so much needed social support that is just not always available with every door being closed on you wherever you go. Just knowing that there is something out there is helpful&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;In using this site you get the feeling that you are not alone that someone understands what you are going through. Further more that, the site went into how you feel and really makes you open up, it is nice to let it all out. It does not present you with a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; situation but ask you questions and requires you to think further than this, which is actually quite revealing&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;It is good to think that there is not set way of coping. It suggest that one cant say do this or that but to think of what you are doing and whether it works for you&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;It helped me to see that as a person I needed help&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;Having it online is obviously the way to go as many things are now available online and people search the net for a lot of things, and as many more people are having access to the internet finding a way to provide that on the internet is a way forward&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;It made you feel you were still a person&hellip;that you have rights&hellip;.that you have a life to live as well&rdquo;.</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;I realize a lot of things I use to worry about are normal with a heavy drinker&hellip; it made me feel not alone, a lot of parents had a lot of problems in there&hellip; ".</em></p>
            <p><em>&rdquo;Seeing others in the same situation, you don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;re the only one dealing with it&rdquo;, &ldquo;nice to know that others have the same experience, it (</em>having a family member that drinks or misuses drugs) <em>affects them in the same way&rdquo;.</em></p>
