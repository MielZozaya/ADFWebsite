            <h1>What is ADF</h1>
<p><strong>ADF </strong>stands for the &lsquo;Alcohol, Drugs & the Family&rsquo; group. This is a group of clinicians and researchers which was officially established in 1980s, although some members have been working in this field since the late 1960s. </p>
<p>The group is focused on: </p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>highlighting the impact alcohol or drug problems can have on the rest of the family, </li>
    <li>developing ways to help family members, </li>
    <li>and raising the profile of research and good practice in this area. </li>
</ul>
<p>The group has been based in different University and National Health Service (NHS) centres over the years, but its core at present is as a two-centre collaboration between the cities of Birmingham and Bath , incorporating some of the NHS and academic institutions in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Two of the pioneer members: Richard Velleman and Jim Orford are still very actively involved; other key members of the group at the present time are Alex Copello and Lorna Templeton, many others have participated in and made significant contributions to the group&rsquo;s research over the years.</p>
