            <h1>Welcome to the web-based support resource</h1> 
            <p>This 5-Step self-help programme is designed by the Alcohol, Drugs and Family <strong>(ADF) </strong>research group. The programme supports family / network members who are concerned about their relative's alcohol or drug misuse.</p> 
            <p>If you are a family or 'network' member (for example: a good friend, a house-sharer, maybe a concerned employer) of someone who is using alcohol or drugs problematically then this self-help programme may be of help to you.</p> 
            <p>It has been found effective in different formats; both in face-to-case delivery by General Practitioners, nurses, health educators and counsellors, as well as in a self-help manual. This support is now being made accessible on the web. If you are a family member use the taps on your right to register and access the programme.</p> 
            <p>If, however, you are a social or health care worker seeking information, then use the contact details below, we would be happy to provide further information.</p>
