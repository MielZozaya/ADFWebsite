    <h1>Exercise&nbsp;3 : Health Effects of my Relative's Behaviour</h1>
    <p>This exercise looks at&nbsp;how your relative&rsquo;s behaviour is affecting your own health. Think carefully about health problems that you have had. Now describe these health problems and how they affect you and your family. Below are two examples to help you along in this exercise. Point your cursor&nbsp;in&nbsp;the empty box below and &quot;<strong>click&quot; </strong>the left mouse button. Type in&nbsp;the information relevant to your own situation in the boxes. When you have finished, select&nbsp;the &quot;<strong>submit</strong>&quot; button.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will automatically upload your responses&nbsp;and clear&nbsp;the space for you to type in more responses.&nbsp; When you are through with this exercise, click on the &quot;<strong>next page</strong>&quot; button to continue with the programme. Remember to type in as many health problems that come to mind.</p> <div style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;">
