<p><font face="Verdana">Step One should have helped me to:</font></p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Think more about my situation and the problems that I might be having</font> </li>
    <li>Identify stresses and strains relevant to my situation and that of my family&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Identify any health problems that I have </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">It is possible that you may feel upset and overwhelmed after looking at Step One. It is okay to feel like this.&nbsp; Other family members in similar circumstances, have told us they often feel like this. You may feel that the only solution to your situation is for your relative to stop drinking or taking drugs. Your relative will seek help when the time is right for them but in the meantime this programme can help you to deal with you and the problems that you are having. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Try to work through the rest of the&nbsp;programme in your own way and in your own time so it can be of help to you. </font></p>
